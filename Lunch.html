  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ol>
    <br><strong>1. </strong>​3 cups Edmonds standard flour
    <br><strong>2. </strong>6 tsp Edmonds baking powder
    <br><strong>3. </strong>¼ tsp salt
    <br><strong>4. </strong>75g butter, softened
    <br><strong>5. </strong>1 to 1½ cups milk(with a little bit extra)
   <h3>Directions</h3>
   <br><strong>1. </strong> Preheat the oven to 220ºC. Grease or flour a baking tray.
   <br><strong>2. </strong> Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
   <br><strong>3. </strong> Add the milk and quickly mix with a round-bladed table knife to a soft dough. For light and tender scones the mixture should be quite soft and a little sticky. Scrape the dough onto the floured baking tray and flour the top.
   <br><strong>4. </strong>Working quickly, pat the dough out to 2cm thickness and with a floured knife cut it into 12 even-sized pieces, then separate the scones to allow 2cm space between them. Brush the tops with milk.
   <br><strong>5. </strong>Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool, wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep them soft.
